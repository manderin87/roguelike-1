Run main in edu.brown.cs.roguelike.game.RogueLike for our Lanterna demo, or
compile with `mvn clean package` and run the executable jar in game/target/.

Commands:

'n' - generate a new level
's' - save the current level
'l' - load the last-saved level
'q' - quit the demo

You must use either 'q' or eclipse to quit, as terminal-close event handling
is not supported

Resizing is also not supported
