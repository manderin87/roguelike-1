Run game by:

  1) Running main in edu.brown.cs.roguelike.game.rogueLike.game.Roguelike
  2) Compiling with 'mvn clean package' and running the executable jar in game/target:

        java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar target/game-1.jar

Commands:

'N' - generate a new level
'S' - save the current level
'L' - load the last-saved level
'q' - quit the demo

'i' - bring up inventory
'space' - exit inventory (only works when inventory is open)

Move with arrow keys or hjkl

Collect items by moving over them. The only items are jewels, and their only
function is to look pretty. They perform this function very well. Bring up your
inventory to see.

Fight monsters by moving into them. They will not follow you, but will fight
back when attacked. You win if you kill all monsters in a level, and lose if
your hp reaches 0.

You must use either 'q' or eclipse's 'terminate' to quit if running from eclipse,
as terminal-close event handling is not supported.
