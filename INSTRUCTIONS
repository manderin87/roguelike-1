Run game by:

  1) Running main in edu.brown.cs.roguelike.game.rogueLike.game.Roguelike
  2) Compiling with 'mvn clean package' and running the executable jar in game/target:

        java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar target/game-1.jar

NOTE: If running in Eclipse, you may need to set your working directory to:

	${workspace_loc:rogue}/game

Commands:
'o' - observe the world, move the cursor to see what is on a tile
'q' - quaff potion, press the letter key of the potion
'w' - wield weapon, press the letter key of the weapon

'i' - bring up inventory
'space' - exit inventory and observe screens

'N' - generate a new level
'S' - save the current level
'L' - load the last-saved level
'Q' - quit the demo

Move with arrow keys or jkl




Collect items by moving over them. Bring up your inventory to see your items with i.

Fight monsters by moving into them. They will not follow you, but will fight
back when attacked. You win if you kill all monsters in a level, and lose if
your hp reaches 0.

You must use either 'Q' or eclipse's 'terminate' to quit if running from eclipse,
as terminal-close event handling is not supported.
