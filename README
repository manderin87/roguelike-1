Roguelike final project

Week 1

cody, jte, lelberty

*** Current bugs: ***

- Terminal resizing isn't supported.
- Terminal close isn't supported. You need to either press 'q' to quit or
  use eclipse to stop the process



*** Package structure: *** 

all below are prefixed with edu.brown.cs.roguelike

engine.events - action/event handling abstraction
engine.graphics - graphics (Lanterna) classes
engine.level - all classes that collectively make up a Level
engine.proc - procedural generation
engine.save - all save-game logic

engine.graphics.test - a simple test implementation of Application and Layer
engine.level.test - unit tests for level classes - primarily serialization
engine.save.test - unit tests for save-game logic classes

game - a simple Lanterna demo of the features we've implemented

Then we also have some support classes, all located in (with no prefix):

cs195n - TA support code we use


*** Engine reqs: *** 

- Some interface exists to wrap the frontend

engine.graphics.LanternaFrontend

- A Lanterna frontend implements this interface

engine.graphics.Application

- Engine has some concept of a level

engine.level.Level

- Engine has some concept of a level generator

engine.proc.LevelGenerator

- At least one level generator implementation exists in the engine

engine.proc.BSPLevelGenerator

- Levels can be saved and loaded

engine.save.SaveManager is responsible for serializing and deserializing Levels



*** Game reqs: ***

- Some use of Lanterna is demonstrated

Run main in game.RogueLike, which is our Lanterna demo

- A saved level can be loaded to demonstrate the engine feature

You can save/load levels using 's' and 'l' (see instructions for details)


Approximate number of hours:
